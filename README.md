## chapter.site.template 🚪 
![:octocat:](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png ":octocat:")The Project has been started by Juuso (jeukku) in order to form a template example   
that could be used across The Zeitgeist Movement Chapters' websites hosted on any GitHub Repository.


## The Project's main structure

| [![Jekyll Logo](http://u.cubeupload.com/boqsc/jekyllsmall.png)](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) | Yekyll structure description  | |
|:-:|-|-|
| 📂_includes | These are the partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts and posts to facilitate reuse. ❗️🚩 The liquid tag`{% include file.ext %}` can be used to include the partial in`_includes/file.ext`. |
| 📂_layouts | These are the templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen on a post-by-post basis in the [YAML Front Matter](http://127.0.0.1:4000/docs/frontmatter/), which is described in the next section. ❗️🚩 The liquid tag `{{ content }}` is used to inject content into the web page. |
| 📂_posts | Your dynamic content, so to speak. ❗️🚩 The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. |
| 📂_sections | **Can someone take the quest** ❔ We need to fill this. |
| 📂assets | **Can someone take the quest** ❔ We need to fill this interesting space. |
| 📂pages | These are the partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts and posts to facilitate reuse.  |
| 📄_config.yml | Stores configuration data. Many of these options can be specified from the command line executable but it’s easier to specify them here so you don’t have to remember them.
